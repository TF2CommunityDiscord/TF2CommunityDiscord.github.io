<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Your grenade launcher is not your primary, your stickies are
- Pipes are for self defense and extra spam when you don't have stickies loaded
- All demo gameplay in a sense can be boiled down to area denial, every sticky is its own trap, shooting a sticky at an enemy is denying where they're standing
- Learn to lead your pipes and stickies, shoot them where they'll be not where they are, you have no hitscan weapons, dont act like you do
- You are best at mid range, ok at longer range and weak in close range
- You are one of the main engines of a team, if a Medic isn't giving you good heals he's not doing his job
- If you are in a close range fight, bait your teammates, demo is allowed to do so
- Dustbowl is Demoman elementary school, play that a lot to get better
- You are the Engineer's worst enemy, make him suffer

Alright, so the bottom line is; you need to play around your team as much as you can. Demo is very strong alone, but enemies can easily overwhelm you when they get too close (I.E pyros, scouts, even spies sometimes.) 
Always plan ahead too, and I mean ALWAYS. You probably know at this point how much prediction is needed to be effective with demo, so it should be somewhat wired into your brain that you need to be ready for anything anytime. 
Now ideally, your team will still have a medic. Ideally of course, but anyway, if you have a medic and they aren't pocketing you the entire game it is still possible to top score easily. That doesn't mean you can't rely on your medic to heal you at the same time though, hence why playing around the team as a whole is wiser.
if your medic is good, or even they aren't, they will usually flock to the heavy, who for the most part stays around the team if they aren't some aussie tomislav unsual wearing russian god. But moving back into being passive aggressive, you will want to learn how to switch weapons effectivly when you are rushing enemies.
What I mean by that is, you'll want to learn the pipe into sticky or vise versa technique. All you really have to do is figure out what to use when the situation calls for it, so like, if you are being rushed by a revved heavy, and stock scout, and a stock pyro, you'll want to first figure out who is closest to you. Then you need to figure out which weapon to use. If the pyro is closest, use stickies or melee, as pipes can be reflected. If the scout is closest, pipes if it is easiest. If the heavy is closest, you are probably dead already.
You just need to be on your feet is really all I am trying to say here.
