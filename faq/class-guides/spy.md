- Use your gun (stock is best, don't touch the Diamondback). L'Etranger is good if you rely heavily on your knife. Keep in mind that you can consistently 3-4 shot light classes at close-mid range with stock. With the stock revolver, you are in theory able to win fights against scouts and soldiers if you land the first shot and dodge even one of their shots.
- Cloak is invaluable, don't trade on demand free positioning for a get outta jail free card (in the form of the DR[^DR]). And C&D[^CD] tends to build bad habits of doing nothing. Stock cloak keeps you moving and keeps you active.
- Your knife is a tool for picks, but don't rely on it exclusively for kills. Stock, Big Earner and YER[^YER] are fun in pubs. Kunai in pubs teaches you an aggressive playstyle that'll cause you more trouble than it's worth down the line.
- Find routes, bits of map geometry, places where people tend to gather in the maps you play and prey on them there.
- Find techniques you can refine to use consistently and incorperate into your playstyle, trickstabs are an example but not the only thing you can do as Spy. 
- Find ways for your gameplay to improve, note mistakes and find ways around them. 
- There are so many ways to play spy, I personally play full stock with around a 60/40 knife to gun kills ratio. Others favor their knives for all of their kills, others prefer the Amby[^Amby] as a playstyle addition to add more damage at mid-close range. I used to exclusively use the Big Earner, L'Etranger, and C&D as a stoplight playstyle where stopping and going is the name of the game. Between waiting for the right moment and chains of stabs where the speed boost drives your effective engagement range after stabs.
- Find a way to play this canvas of a class that best suits your ever-evolving ever-improving and ever-growing playstyle.

As Im sure you know, the DR is an amazing tool for escaping bad situations as spy, as well as fooling the enemy. Its instant activation alongside it's temporary speed boost and high damage resistance allow for you to evade most things thrown at you. 
For comparison, the DR grants a 75% damage resistance to all types after the first attack (and its activation) alongside 65% damage resist and complete afterburn resistance which fades into 20% after 3 seconds. You are also granted the privilege of not being exposed when bumping into enemies, which can help a lot when you are running away and panicking. 
Since you are using the kunai specifically, this means that you are capable of tanking 279 damage at maximum before dying after the initial hit assuming you are full health, as your estimated health pool while holding the DR is 280 (I.E 70 / 25%). You can live through most hazards, aside from full charged huntsman headshots, full charged sniper headshots, and direct explosion crits from soldiers and demos, alongside shotguns. 
This doesn't even account for over heal and the other knives, but as we've already established you use the kunai, which will grant huge health pools after a stab. This means you are essentially unkillable after a successful stab into a immediate DR pop. 
After the initial pop though, your health drops all the way down to 200 (70 / 35%), then eventually a pitiful 87.5 (70 / 80%) when those 3 seconds end.
You get about 7 seconds of cloak total, so that is plenty of time to run away and reposition once you've been attacked, exposed, or even taken self damage. 
Now that we've discussed the mechanics of the DR, let's get into actual strategies for using it. 
For one, it should be obvious that holding it out for safety is a good habit to have, as you can never know as a weak 70 hp spy when a stray arrow, rocket, or sticky will surprise you, even when you aren't behind enemy lines. 
Next, you should always keep mental notes of possible escape routes and positions to run to when your DR activates. You never want to be caught with your pants down as spy, and it will happen if you don't plan ahead. A lot of players are used to dealing with the DR, so they know to keep shooting even after the initial activation to try and kill you for good. 
That leads into the next point, practice evading enemies. The DR literally grants you the speed of a slightly faster scout for 3 entire seconds. It's especially difficult for enemies to track you due to the lack of bumping  and reveal discussed earlier, so use that to your advantage when your trying to evade alongside the speed boost. 
If you start taking damage or are somehow being tracked by an enemy even with the lack of cloak reveal, then change your direction or even improvise by damage surfing away. There is literally no way for the enemy to see you unless a pyro is on your ass, and if that is the case, you are better off trying to jump from a ledge, turn a corner, or run to teammates before you die. 
You'll find evasion is the most important part of the DR, and it is something you need to practice in order to effectivly use it.
Alright, we can now talk about decloaking. 
the DR has one of the loudest and most obvious decloak sounds in the game, I don't know how much louder in decibels it is by comparison to the other watches, but it is certainly loud enough for a revved up firing heavy to hear it if you are close enough. 
But that leads to the main point here, you want to decloak behind corners, walls, whatever the hell you can find as long as you are behind cover. This is because the sound gets a lot quieter and it makes it way less obvious. Ideally you'll want to be a decent distance away too, as this also reduces the sound. Sometimes you can even use high ground or elevation and the enemy will turn around only to not see you when decloaking (tf2 players don't look up). I would try and wait a few seconds before running in to stab after this though, as enemies will still turn around if they are aware enough or paranoid enough.
And try to remember it takes about 1 second for the decloak to fully finish, so plan for this in advance when going for stabs.
Ok ok, I'll really start getting into some advanced uses for the DR.
The DR is a great getaway tool, but an even better enemy engagement tool. Remember the speed boost? You keep that after the initial activation, even when you instantly decloak upon initial activation.
What does this mean? Well my friend, it mans you are able to maintain the speed of a scout alongside having the ability to backstab and use your revolver. 
I'm sure I don't have to explain why this is powerful, but I'll go ahead and say that a spy who can utilize the DR like this, alongside it's other perks, is capable of being one of the most annoying and unkillable players within a lobby, which is why it has such a bad rep.
Combined with the kunai, which as previously mentioned basically grants invulnerability, (Upwards of 210 HP upon a stab), this allows you to get in, then get out with complete ease.
You also mentioned you use the L'etranger. 
The L'etranger has the unique ability the grant cloak meter when shooting enemies. This allows for incredible synergy with the DR, as it usually takes upwards of 20 full seconds to refill your cloak meter. 
Assuming you have the aim to back it up, this basically means you can always have your DR ready to go, as long as you have enemies nearby to shoot at. 
So lets go over the ideas here:
You have the ability to instantly cloak and run away to any position with complete reveal invulnerability.
You can tank almost every attack in the game without much of a scratch.
You can have your DR ready almost always assuming you can hit your shots.
I'd hope at this point your starting to get the picture. The DR is by far one of the most powerful watches at spies disposal.
Theres alot more cases to cover, but the final thing I'll say here is that alot of it comes down to gamesense. 
The best way to improve at the DR is by using it (funny isn't that?). You won't get better at spy by reading all of this shit and trying to apply it in one single game. Take notes of what works and what doesn't, analyze enemy patterns and teammate patterns, and just generally do your best to learn from your mistakes.
