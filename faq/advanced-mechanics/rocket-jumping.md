# Rocket jumping

## Where to start
Rocket jumping can be daunting at first, but it has gotten easier to get into over the years. The tutorials produced today are fantastic, and they explain pretty much everything you need to know about it. Additionally there are dedicated servers made specifically for practicing jumping. The two most popular ones are:
  1. [jump academy servers](https://jumpacademy.tf/servers): A great place to start learning. You can join Dedicated Servers, where the only jump map is jump_academy2. This should be your starting point. Later on, you can join Soldier Rotation servers, which host many different soldier jump maps. You can also join their [discord](https://discord.me/jumpacademy) to get advice quickly.
  2. [tempus servers](https://tempus2.xyz/): These servers are aimed more towards experienced jumpers. They have leaderboards for every map so you can try to beat other people's times. There is also an overall leaderboard, based on how many maps you beat (the harder the map, the more points you get); and how many top times you have (top 10 times on certain maps or bonus jumps).

Every jump map is placed into a tier, where tier 1 is the **easiest** and tier 6 is the **most difficult**. Note that if you just want to get good in real games with soldier or trolldier, there is a certain cutoff where jump maps won't really help you improve much in real games, and you should probably focus on other areas of your gameplay. That level is about tier 4 or harder tier 3. Although some techniques, like wall shots, are still useful if you can do them at a higher level.

If you are really new to jumping (meaning you haven't beaten a jump map before, or you don't really know which tier you can attempt), I recommend starting with jump_academy2. This will give you good foundations and introduce you to jumping one technique at a time, making it a lot easier to learn. Once you can beat the easy courses, you can attempt other maps too, mainly from the tier 2 or 3 category. Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1907vPaXC_hS7HJaVnO2ugTOcV4ztIUzsOAQGs_5hwPY) for some good maps to choose from.

Some useful commands for both servers (you can type these in chat):
   - `!s` saves your current position.
   - `!t` teleports to the saved position.
   - `!r` restarts your run, you go back to spawn.
   - `!mi` displays the map info, includes: tier, author etc.
   - `!skeys` shows which keys you (or the person you spectate) presses.
   - `!speedo` shows you how fast you travel.
   - `!jumpqol fakedelay 0` simulates 0 ping rockets, really useful for syncs.

If you don't have a server near you, or your internet just isn't really good you can still jump offline, and you can even use a lot of these commands with the [offline jump pack](https://jump.tf/forum/index.php?topic=3294.0).

## Recommended tutorial series
[Firestabber](https://www.youtube.com/@Firestabber) has many good jumping tutorials, this includes very basic, and advanced techniques too.

The best place to start your journey is the jump academy jump through series:

His other good series is a collection of mainly niche techniques explained by other creators is also great but less useful for beginners:

{% include youtube.hmtl id="?listType=2PD_z1JbdB8&list=PLGU70WXXvX7ulHRVZIf_mAuLdMiO_3ojW" %}

<small> Technical explanation: ildprut made a nice [documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jr00chyg20vuibd/Review.pdf?e=1&dl=0) explaining pretty much everything you need to know about the technical aspects of jumping. It's not really needed to be good at jumping, but it can be an interesting read. </small>
